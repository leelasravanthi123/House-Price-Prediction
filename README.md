# House-Price-Prediction

House price prediction involves using machine learning techniques to estimate the market value of residential properties. It's a common application in real estate, aiding buyers, sellers, agents, and investors in making informed decisions. Here's an overview of the process:
1. Data Collection:  

Features: Gather data on various aspects of properties (size, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, amenities, age, etc.).

Target Variable: Obtain actual sale prices or property values.

2. Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.

3 . Model Selection:

Choose appropriate regression models for prediction, such as:

Linear Regression: Assumes a linear relationship between features and target variable.

4 .Model Training and Evaluation:

Training: Use a portion of the dataset to train the model on historical data.

Testing: Assess model performance on unseen data to measure its predictive ability.

Evaluation Metrics: Common metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score (Coefficient of Determination).

7. Prediction and Interpretation:
   
Making Predictions: Deploy the trained model to predict house prices for new or unseen data.
